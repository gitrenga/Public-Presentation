- **The Accidental Engineer**
  - Late access to computers & software
  - Playing constant "catch up" on knowledge
  - Then I stumbled into a gem: **TDD**
  - From struggle to **happiness** in development

## 🔄 What is TDD?

### 🎯 The Mindset Shift:
```
FROM: "How do I solve this problem?"
TO:   "How will I know when it's solved?"
```

## 💻 Live Coding Demo: Building with TDD
**(10 minutes)**

### 🎭 Myth vs Reality Check

| **Myth** | **Reality** |
|----------|-------------|
| "TDD slows you down" | Initial investment, long-term speed gain |
| "100% coverage required" | Focus on behavior, not metrics |
| "Only for unit tests" | Applies to all testing levels |
| "Too complex for beginners" | Start small, build confidence |

### Key Observations from Demo:
- ✅ Started with simplest possible implementation
- ✅ Each test forced better code design
- ✅ Confidence to make changes immediately
- ✅ Clear specification of behavior
- ✅ Refactoring became fearless

## 💔 The Pain → 💚 The Transformation
**(7 minutes)**

### Before TDD: The Struggles

**🔥 Fear of the Unknown**
- Problem: Too many unknowns, difficult end-to-end solutions
- **TDD Solution**: No need to know everything - take manageable small steps

**😰 Lack of Clarity & Communication**
- Problem: Shy away from feedback, unclear requirements
- **TDD Solution**: Clear intent, concrete & quick feedback

**🚫 Tentative Programming**
- Problem: "Don't touch working code!"
- **TDD Solution**: Confident experiments with aggressive refactoring safety net

**📝 Requirements Misunderstanding**
- Problem: What's written vs what's meant
- **TDD Solution**: Requirements → Acceptance Criteria → Test Cases

**⏰ Poor Estimates**
- Problem: "How many problems to solve?" (vague)
- **TDD Solution**: "How many things to test?" (concrete: 3 vs 30, 3 vs 5)

**📚 Living Documentation**
- Problem: Outdated docs
- **TDD Solution**: Executable specifications that never lie
