- **The Accidental Engineer**
  - Late access to computers & software
  - Playing constant "catch up" on knowledge
  - Then I stumbled into a gem: **TDD**
  - From struggle to **happiness** in development

## 🔄 What is TDD?

### 🎯 The Mindset Shift:
```
FROM: "How do I solve this problem?"
TO:   "How will I know when it's solved?"
```

## 💻 Live Coding Demo: Building with TDD
**(10 minutes)**

### 🎭 Myth vs Reality Check

| **Myth** | **Reality** |
|----------|-------------|
| "TDD slows you down" | Initial investment, long-term speed gain |
| "100% coverage required" | Focus on behavior, not metrics |
| "Only for unit tests" | Applies to all testing levels |
| "Too complex for beginners" | Start small, build confidence |

### Key Observations from Demo:
- ✅ Started with simplest possible implementation
- ✅ Each test forced better code design
- ✅ Confidence to make changes immediately
- ✅ Clear specification of behavior
- ✅ Refactoring became fearless

## 💔 The Pain → 💚 The Transformation
### Before TDD: The Struggles

**🔥 Fear of the Unknown**
- Problem: Too many unknowns, difficult end-to-end solutions
- **TDD Solution**: No need to know everything - take manageable small steps

**😰 Lack of Clarity & Communication**
- Problem: Shy away from feedback, unclear requirements
- **TDD Solution**: Clear intent, concrete & quick feedback

**🚫 Tentative Programming**
- Problem: "Don't touch working code!"
- **TDD Solution**: Confident experiments with aggressive refactoring safety net

**📝 Requirements Misunderstanding**
- Problem: What's written vs what's meant
- **TDD Solution**: Requirements → Acceptance Criteria → Test Cases

**⏰ Poor Estimates**
- Problem: "How many problems to solve?" (vague)
- **TDD Solution**: "How many things to test?" (concrete: 3 vs 30, 3 vs 5)

**📚 Living Documentation**
- Problem: Outdated docs
- **TDD Solution**: Executable specifications that never lie

### Testable vs Non-Testable S/W
<img width="1530" height="531" alt="Screenshot from 2025-08-09 15-17-17" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a315fdf-3de3-4265-bc58-89b88d182ff2" />

**CODE**

**❌ Non-Testable:**

```java
// Hard to test - direct external dependencies
public class OrderService {
    public void processOrder(Order order) {
        // Direct database call
        database.save(order);
        // Direct email service call  
        emailService.sendConfirmation(order.getEmail());
        // Direct payment processing
        paymentGateway.charge(order.getAmount());
    }
}
```

**✅ Testable:**
```java
// Easy to test - dependency injection
public class OrderService {
    private final OrderRepository repository;
    private final EmailService emailService;
    private final PaymentService paymentService;
    
    public OrderService(OrderRepository repository, 
                       EmailService emailService,
                       PaymentService paymentService) {
        this.repository = repository;
        this.emailService = emailService;
        this.paymentService = paymentService;
    }
    
    public OrderResult processOrder(Order order) {
        repository.save(order);
        emailService.sendConfirmation(order.getEmail());
        return paymentService.charge(order.getAmount());
    }
}

// Now we can test with mocks/stubs
@Test
public void shouldProcessOrderSuccessfully() {
    // Given
    OrderRepository mockRepo = mock(OrderRepository.class);
    EmailService mockEmail = mock(EmailService.class);
    PaymentService mockPayment = mock(PaymentService.class);
    
    when(mockPayment.charge(100.0)).thenReturn(PaymentResult.success());
    
    OrderService service = new OrderService(mockRepo, mockEmail, mockPayment);
    
    // When
    OrderResult result = service.processOrder(new Order(100.0));
    
    // Then
    assertTrue(result.isSuccess());
    verify(mockRepo).save(any(Order.class));
    verify(mockEmail).sendConfirmation(anyString());
}
```
