## 💻 Live Coding Demo: Building with TDD
**(10 minutes)**

### 🎭 Myth vs Reality Check

| **Myth** | **Reality** |
|----------|-------------|
| "TDD slows you down" | Initial investment, long-term speed gain |
| "100% coverage required" | Focus on behavior, not metrics |
| "Only for unit tests" | Applies to all testing levels |
| "Too complex for beginners" | Start small, build confidence |

### Key Observations from Demo:
- ✅ Started with simplest possible implementation
- ✅ Each test forced better code design
- ✅ Confidence to make changes immediately
- ✅ Clear specification of behavior
- ✅ Refactoring became fearless
