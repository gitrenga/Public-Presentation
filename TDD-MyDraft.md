# Live Coding

# Bitter & Sweet

  - Fear of Unknown - Problem of too many - Difficult Problem - End to End Solutioning Attempt
    
        No need to know - Manageable small steps - Who Cares - Evolutionary design
    
  - Fear & Lack of clarity - Comm. less - Shy Away from feedback
    
        Clarity on intent - helpful, concrete & Quick feedback
    
  - Tentative Programming - Dont touch a working code
    
        Confident Experiments - Aggresive refactoring - Safety Net
    
  - Requirement Misunderstanding - Written vs Meant
    
        Req - Acceptance Creteria - Verification Points - Test Case - TDD
    
  - Estimates
    
        Number of problems to solve VS Number of things to Test (3 VS 30/ 3 VS 5)
    
        Better breakdown & comm.

  - Documentation

        Live & Executable

   - Design

         Evolutionary,YAGNI, NO Premature Optimization

         Less Cognitive burden
      
# TDD Lego Blocks

  - Failing Test - Write Code - Passing Test - Refactor
  - Testable vs non Testable Code
  - ODD & Arch
```    
    1. Long Running Process
    2. Parallel vs Sequencial execution
    3. Code & Dependency Path - Stratergy Used
    4. Cache vs DB
    5. Encryption before persistence
    6. External Call (HTTP,DBQuery,Messaging,Async,Caching)
    7. Garbage Collection Frequency
    8. DORA Metrics 
    9. Arch Constraints
```

# Anti Patterns

  - Test Code NOT Behaviour
  - Test first & Test last both are TDD 
  - Only code is tested NOT Infra/Platform
  - 100% Test Coverage (Counter Productive) VS Meaningful Test
  - More Asserts in Single Test
  - Exposing only for Testing
  - Ice Cream Cone vs Test Pyramid
  - Tests are order dependent
  - Testing implementation (Too Many Test) - Test Cancer

# üéØ **KEY TAKEAWAYS**

### **DO:**
- ‚úÖ Write self-testing code
- ‚úÖ Follow test pyramid structure  
- ‚úÖ Use appropriate test doubles
- ‚úÖ Keep tests fast and reliable
- ‚úÖ Write tests before or with code
- ‚úÖ Monitor production systems
- ‚úÖ Use exploratory testing
- ‚úÖ Maintain clean test code

### **DON'T:**
- ‚ùå Rely only on broad stack tests
- ‚ùå Ignore flaky tests
- ‚ùå Focus only on coverage numbers
- ‚ùå Test implementation details
- ‚ùå Skip refactoring tests
- ‚ùå Neglect production monitoring
- ‚ùå Create brittle UI tests
- ‚ùå Over-mock dependencies

1. **Testing is a Design Activity**: Good tests improve code design and provide living documentation
2. **Balance is Key**: Use the right mix of different test types (Test Pyramid)
3. **Fast Feedback**: Prioritize fast, reliable tests for quick feedback loops  
4. **Production Matters**: Extend testing thinking into production with monitoring and observability
5. **Evolution**: Testing practices must evolve with architecture (monolith ‚Üí microservices)
6. **Culture**: Foster a testing culture where quality is everyone's responsibility
